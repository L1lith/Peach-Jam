# What is Peach? 
Peach is a game engine framework. If Pixi.js is your render engine, and Matter.js is your physics engine, then Peach is the frame of the car that holds them together. 


You only have to write your game once, then by using plugins you can swap out your engines instantly without having to rewrite anything or reconnect them manually. Personally I also find the Peach API simpler than Pixi.js for example, so you can use Pixi for performance reasons without having to write for it's API.

# a Work in Progress
This framework is still in hot development. Notably physics has not been implemented yet. The following features either have been or are on the wish list to be implemented:

## Implemented Features
- [x] Pixi.js Rendering Support
- [ ] Physics Support
- [x] Tiled Map Editor (woo!)
- [ ] Solid.js Isomorphic Rendering
- [ ] Controller API integration

# If you like this project
Please don't be afraid to make a pull request or star the project. It's difficult for me to develop this framework by myself, so any help is appreciated.
